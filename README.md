# Other Notes

**Currently, bows are shelved as a project, as are crossbows. They're unreasonably complicated for no reason whatsoever.**

This isn't intended for public use. I've borrowed from several mods, including Hammers! and Spades! by https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/marwinekk/ and Mekanism for textures. It's intended for a specific, private Minecraft server.
