# LMHPSCIT
A CIT pack for LMHPS and mainly the Slimefun plugin.

Use with https://citresewn.shcm.io/, install as you would any resource pack.

This isn't intended for public use. I've borrowed from several mods, including Hammers! and Spades! by https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/marwinekk/, for textures. It's intended for a specific, private Minecraft server
